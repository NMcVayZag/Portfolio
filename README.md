# [Project 1: Helium Cryptocurrency Mining Performance Linear Regrssion Model](https://github.com/NMcVayZag/Helium-Cryptocurreny-Project)
 - Performed a study that includes a data analysis report on my Helium cryptocurrency miner performance & the relationship between cryptocurrency and equity markets.
      - Concluded that the correlation coefficient between Helium and Ethereum prices to be 0.64 which means they are significantly positively correlated with one another.
      - Discovered that there's actually a stronger positive correlation between the S&P 500 Index and the price of Helium that sits at 0.78. This is most likely due to the vast magnitude of securities that are expressed by the S&P 500 index versus that of Ethereum.
 - Conducting hypothesis testing to analyze if external factors have a statistically significant impact on Helium mining performance.
 - Finally, the last peice of the study includes building out a classification model using a decision tree classifier approach KNN (k nearest neighbor) approach to predict whether the helium mining earnings were going higher than usual for that day (>median earned per day).
