# [Project 1: Helium Cryptocurrency Mining Performance Linear Regrssion Model](https://github.com/NMcVayZag/Helium-Cryptocurreny-Project)
 - Performed a study that includes a data analysis report on my Helium cryptocurrency miner performance & the relationship between cryptocurrency and equity markets. This study then dives deeper by conducting some hypothesis testing to analyze if external factors have a statistically significant impact on Helium mining performance. Finally, the last peice of the study includes building out a classification model using a decision tree classifier approach KNN (k nearest neighbor) approach to predict whether the helium mining earnings were going higher than usual for that day (>median earned per day).
